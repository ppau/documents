\part{Principles \& Objects of the Party}
Pirate Party Australia strives to protect and expand civil and digital liberties, social equality and freedom of culture. We seek to safeguard the inalienable rights of all natural persons of Australia and the freedoms of the emergent global information society. The Party seeks to have these values reflected in the laws and institutions of Australia.

The growing surveillance of the citizen offends the very notions of a liberal and open democracy. Overbearing and restrictive private monopolies constructed via regimes of antiquated, unfair and unbalanced laws which prevent the free development of culture and ideas are detrimental to financial, economic and cultural outcomes for the citizens of Australia. Changing these laws, and ensuring the protection of these values are the goals of the Pirate Party Australia. 

Founded on the same principles as other International Pirate Parties, it is part of a global movement against increasingly draconian copyright and patent laws, and the erosion of the right to privacy. The basic tenets of this movement are Free Culture, Civil Liberty and Intellectual Rights Reform.

The Party seeks to represent the emerging digital society and offer a new form of politics driven from the grassroots. We believe in exploring the potential of participatory and deliberative democracy, and finding new ways to promote trust between citizens and the state through greater transparency and open government. The Party intends to contest Australian Federal Elections in both the House of Representatives and Senate.

An elected representative of the party must not vote for or compromise on any legislation that impinges on or compromises the rights stated here in this constitution.


Objectives of the Pirate Party Australia also include:
\begin{itemize}
\item To construct, advocate and implement policies in accordance with the principles stated within this constitution; and
\item To generally educate and bring awareness to the issues that are stated within this constitution; and
\item To educate and encourage other political entities to adopt our objectives, whether that be through advocacy or preference allocation.
\end{itemize}


The Pirate Party Australia firmly holds belief in democracy, and rejects any use of force, intimidation or physical violence as the means to achieving political goals. We vehemently reject any and all forms of political or public corruption.
